The Python code is a simple program which asks the user to input 
values for his or her blood pressure.

The program should output "Your blood pressure is normal" if the systolic is inside the
range 80-120, or if the diastolic is inside the range 60-80. Otherwise it should output
"Your blood pressure is abnormal."
